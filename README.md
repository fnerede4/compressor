# compressor
This project compress a text file with binary search tree. It takes a text file named "compin.txt" then creates a new text file with the name "compout.txt". After compressing, you can decompress the compressed text file, again which is named "compout.txt". And  decompressed version of "compout.txt" will be "decompout.txt" which is the original form of our initial text file.
